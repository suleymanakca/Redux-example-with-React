It is an example that it gets data from API, stored them using Redux<br>
gives the option to submit and re-render the list. 

Before you run:

### `install i  redux react-redux redux-thunk`

And visit the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

If you want to use Redux Devtools as a Chrome extension

### `npm install --save-dev remote-redux-devtools`<br>

I kept going with the Brad Traversy'course.
